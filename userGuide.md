Built with cutting-edge web technologies for optimal performance. The frontend leverages React 19 with TypeScript for type-safe component development, Tailwind CSS 4 for utility-first styling with a custom light theme (white background, navy blue text, black accents), and shadcn/ui for accessible component primitives. Features an animated Fibonacci spiral demonstrating the golden ratio. Deployment runs on auto-scaling infrastructure with global CDN for instant worldwide access.

## Using Your Website

Navigate through sections by clicking "Home", "About", "Experience", or "Projects" in the top navigation bar. The page smoothly scrolls to each section. On mobile devices, tap the menu icon to reveal navigation options.

The hero section features an animated Fibonacci spiral with golden ratio visualization, plus a typing effect greeting. Click "Let's talk" to send an email.

The About section shares your journey from electrical engineering at Southampton to data science at NYIT, with current IT work at Air Alliance. The Experience section uses tabs - click "Air Alliance Ltd.", "Bengal Airlift Limited", or "Robi Axiata Ltd." to view each role. The Projects section highlights your ML work including PCB defect detection AI, F1 podium predictor, and NYC taxi fare prediction, plus hardware projects like biodegradable PCBs.

## Managing Your Website

Update content by editing component files in the Code panel. Modify your name, bio, experience entries, and project details directly in the React components. Change colors and styling through the Tailwind configuration and CSS variables in `index.css`.

Monitor site traffic and visitor analytics through the Dashboard panel after publishing. Adjust website title and logo in Settings → General. Configure custom domains in Settings → Domains to use your own web address.
